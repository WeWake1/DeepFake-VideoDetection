2. ABSTRACT (Draft Template)
================================================================================

Deepfake technology poses significant threats to digital media authenticity, 
necessitating robust detection methods that generalize across different 
manipulation techniques and datasets. We propose a dual-stream architecture 
combining EfficientNet-B4 and EfficientNet-B0 backbones with ConvLSTM temporal 
modeling for deepfake video detection. Our approach processes videos at two 
resolutions (224×224 high-quality and 112×112 JPEG-compressed low-quality) to 
capture both spatial artifacts and compression inconsistencies introduced by 
deepfake generation. 

We trained two models: Model Alpha specialized on Celeb-DF achieving 100% 
accuracy on 518 test videos, and Model Beta trained on a combined dataset of 
16,070 videos from Celeb-DF, FaceForensics++, and Google DFD datasets. While 
Model Alpha demonstrated perfect accuracy on in-domain data, it exhibited poor 
cross-dataset generalization (34.64% on DFDC). Model Beta, trained on diverse 
manipulation techniques, showed improved cross-dataset performance [results 
pending]. Our architecture consists of 58.5M parameters and processes 10-frame 
sequences, achieving real-time inference at [X] FPS on RTX 4090 GPU.

Key contributions include: (1) dual-stream multi-resolution architecture 
exploiting compression artifacts, (2) comprehensive evaluation across four 
benchmark datasets, (3) analysis of specialization vs. generalization trade-offs 
in deepfake detection, and (4) investigation of cross-dataset transferability 
challenges.

3.1 Background and Motivation
------------------------------

3.2 Problem Statement
---------------------
Current deepfake detectors often achieve high accuracy on datasets they were 
trained on but fail when tested on unseen datasets or manipulation techniques. 
This research addresses:

10. CONCLUSION
================================================================================

10.1 Summary
------------
This research investigated cross-dataset deepfake detection using a dual-stream 
EfficientNet architecture with ConvLSTM temporal modeling. We developed two 
models: Model Alpha trained exclusively on Celeb-DF achieving perfect in-domain 
accuracy (100%), and Model Beta trained on 16,070 videos from three diverse 
datasets (Celeb-DF, FaceForensics++, Google DFD).

Our experiments revealed critical insights about the specialization vs. 
generalization trade-off in deepfake detection. Model Alpha's dramatic 
performance drop on DFDC (34.64%) demonstrates that models can achieve near-
perfect accuracy on one dataset while failing on another, highlighting the 
importance of multi-dataset training for real-world applications.

The dual-stream architecture successfully exploited both high-quality spatial 
features and compression artifacts, while ConvLSTM temporal modeling captured 
inter-frame inconsistencies. [Model Beta results will determine if multi-dataset 
training achieves better cross-dataset generalization.]

techniques. While our dual-stream architecture shows promise, the field requires 
continuous innovation to keep pace with advancing synthesis methods. Multi-
dataset training and cross-dataset evaluation are essential for developing 
robust, deployable detection systems.

Future work should focus on continual learning frameworks that can adapt to 
emerging manipulation techniques, multi-modal detection combining visual and 
audio cues, and adversarially robust architectures. The ultimate goal is 
detection systems that generalize to unseen datasets and manipulation methods 
while maintaining high accuracy and computational efficiency.
